This repo contains `.tex` files and scripts for generating NANOGrav author lists.


## NANOGrav Authorship policy
from [publication policy](http://nanograv.org/governance/)

Note: authors may appeal to the Management Team for exceptions to the authorship policy.

### NANOGrav GW Measurement/Limit Publications

* The authorship of a NANOGrav measurement/limit publication, except for posters and presentations as described in first paragraph of Authorship, shall consist of NANOGrav Full Members, NANOGrav Legacy Members during their first year of Legacy status, and all others who contributed significantly to the publication.
Authors shall be listed alphabetically in order of surname.
For all authors who are not NANOGrav Full Members (or Legacy Members during their first year of legacy status) a statement detailing the specific contributions made to the publication must be provided to the management team.
This statement may be written by the lead/corresponding author or the person seeking authorship.
The Management Team will review the author list during the circulation period.

* Author lists for NANOGrav GW measurement/limit posters, oral presentations (e.g. seminars, colloquia, and conference presentations), and conference proceedings shall be authored by the presenter(s) for the NANOGrav Collaboration (e.g. “Jane Doe for the NANOGrav Collaboration”).
Additional individual authors may be named only with approval of the Management Team.

* NANOGrav GW Measurement/Limit publication author list will begin with "The NANOGrav Collaboration: [alphabetical list of authors]".
This is to be included in the printed version of the paper and should also appear that way on [arXiv](www.arxiv.org).

* A section describing the specific contributions of the authors should be included at the end of the paper.
This section will begin with the text: "An alphabetical-order author list was used for this paper in recognition of the fact that a large, decade-timescale project such as this is necessarily the result of the work of many people.
All authors contributed to the activities of the NANOGrav collaboration leading to the work presented here, and reviewed the manuscript, text, and figures prior to the paper's submission.
Additional specific contributions to this paper are as follows." Followed by a description of the specific contributions of various authors.
If more than one author contributed to the work being described the authors should be listed alphabetically.
For example the NANOGrav stochastic 9-yr paper has: "ZA, KC, PBD, TD, RDF, EF, MEG, GJ, MJ, MTL, LL, MAM, DJN, TTP, SMR, IHS, KS, JKS, and WWZ made observations for this project and developed timing models.
JAE coordinated the writing of the paper.
JAE, RvH, and CMFM led this search by directly running the analysis pipelines..."

* GW Measurement/Limit publications by NANOGrav members that use NANOGrav data from data releases predating the most recent data release need not conform to the requirements listed above; in particular, the author list need not be alphabetical, and need not include all Full Members and Legacy Members during their first year of Legacy status.
Such papers are subject to the other provisions of the NANOGrav publication policy.

### NANOGrav Non-GW Measurement/Limit Publications

* Author lists shall include all people who make significant contributions to the publication.

* Author lists may include specific groups.

* Author order shall be determined by the authors themselves.
A typical situation may be a short list of those who make the most significant contributions to the publication followed by an alphabetical list of those with more ancillary roles.

* Author lists for posters, oral presentations, and conference proceedings that are NANOGrav non-GW-measurement/limit publications may include full author lists or may be abbreviated, e.g. “Jane Doe for the NANOGrav detection group” at the discretion of the authors.

### Publications Not on NANOGrav Science Using NANOGrav Resources
* Publications by NANOGrav members which use NANOGrav resources (data or tools) for non-NANOGrav science are subject to the authorship policies governing NANOGrav data and NANOGrav tools but are not governed by other authorship rules in the NANOGrav publication policy.

### Publications Using NANOGrav Data or Tools
* Publications that use NANOGrav data or NANOGrav tools that are not publicly available shall include the relevant data team or tool developers as authors.
* Publications that use NANOGrav data or NANOGrav tools that are publicly available should consult with the relevant data team or tool developers regarding potential co-authorship.
* For guidance, the corresponding author of a paper or the major participants in a project may consult with the Management Team.
* Publications that use small amounts of published NANOGrav data for illustrative purposes (e.g. for a new detection technique), but which do not present new GW limits/detections, need not include data-takers among the authors.
